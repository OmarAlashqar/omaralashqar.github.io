# Hi, I'm Omar Alashqar

I'm an engineering student and an aspiring creator of things that make a difference.

I have experience working on **Full Stack** software and **Data Engineering** projects. You'll find that I'm a quick learner and tend to keep up with new tech as I'm passionate about software and design.

I've had the pleasure of working with talented teams and I'm always looking for new opportunities.
